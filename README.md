# UFO

## Overview: 

To provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The final result was the working website that allowed for five different categories to filter the data: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

- To navigate through its functionality, the user would need to click on the "Filter Search" boxes provided to the left and enter a valid option for the category to be filtered. If you enter a incorrect fitler or a variable that does not exist in the data, you will get an empty table. In this case, try again.  

- To come back to the original dataset (without filters included) click on the top left where it says "UFO Sightings" and the HTML will get redirected.

## Summary
One drawback is that the dataset used only includes sightings in the United States. This may affect the website because it might not get as much attention from other parts of the World. One recommendation could be to find more data online and insert it in the data file. Additionally, another recommendation could be to futher decorate the website. CSS and Bootstrap have infinite options to make an even more aesthetically pleasant website.
